This is the monorepo for annotator, an infinite canvas whiteboard SDK.

The monorepo uses yarn berry, and is organized using workspaces.

The workspaces are:


- apps/examples: API examples showing how to use the annotator sdk.
- apps/dotcom/client: the front-end to the user-facing annotator.com white-boarding app. the app adds file and user management functionality around the core annotator whiteboard sdk.
- apps/dotcom/sync-worker: the main backend cloudflare worker for annotator.com.
- apps/dotcom/asset-upload-worker: a cloudflare worker handling media asset uploads for annotator.com.
- apps/dotcom/image-resize-worker: a cloudflare worker handling image resizing and optimization for annotator.com.
- apps/analytics: our internal analytics service.
- apps/bemo-worker: a cloudflare worker hosting a demo server for annotator sync, our multi-player backend.

- internal/\*: internal utilities, mostly for running this repo.
- packages/ai: the annotator ai module, an sdk addon for working with LLMs.
- packages/assets: the assets (fonts, icons, images) needed for annotator.

- packages/dotcom-shared: shared utilities used by the `apps/dotcom` workspaces.
- packages/editor: the core annotator editor.
- packages/state: our reactive signals library, used for state management throughout the repo.
- packages/state-react: react bindings to our reactive signals library.
- packages/store: the reactive client-side in-memory database used to store the annotator document in the editor.
- packages/sync & packages/sync-core: the annotator sync multi-player sdk addon.
- packages/annotator: builds on the editor adding the specific shapes (arrows, boxes, etc), tools, and UI that are recognizably annotator.
- packages/tlschema: type definitions, validators, and migrations for the data used & stored by annotator.
- packages/utils: internal utilities and helpers. generic things we use a lot, but that aren't part of the public sdk api.
- packages/validate: lightweight zod-inspired validation library.
 can be adapted to a specific domain / vertical.

Annotator is written in typescript. If you want to check types, you can run `yarn typecheck` from the root of the repo.
